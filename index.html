hi

This page is for this assignment https://www.se.rit.edu/~swen-101/activities/GitHubIOIntro.html

<p>
	For this paragraph about myself, I wanted to say two things:
	1. I don't know HTML, so this is probably going to be really bad.
	2. I don't like putting personal information about myself on the open internet (like my high school and hobbies)
